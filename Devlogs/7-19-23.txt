Today I worked on the following:

- I wrote (Well Github copilot did, really) a python script to generate a LevelJson file to hold level data. (Man, I love scripting things!)
- I moved some files around to make the project more organized.
- I added a new class called LevelManager to handle loading and unloading levels. (WIP)

I'm not sure if I'll be able to work on this tomorrow, but I'll try to get some work done on it.

(Note, the list will get added to as I work on it today :D)
