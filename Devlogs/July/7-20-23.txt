Devlog from 7-20-23 @ 11:32 PM cause I hate myself for some reason

- I worked on UI rendering and rendering the level chunk
- I tweaked the Python script to generate the level chunk
- File structure is now a bit more organized (I think so anyway :p)
- I changed my VS Code insiders font to Jetbrains Mono :D (I like it a lot)
