Devlog from 7-24-23 @ 8:42 PM

- I worked on the Dialouge Writer, it works, but breaks if you add more dialouge than the screen can hold (It cannot wrap text yet Sadly)
- Changed the NPC structure to be included in a Scene

Hopefully i'll get some work done tomorrow, I've been trying to commit at least once every day.
