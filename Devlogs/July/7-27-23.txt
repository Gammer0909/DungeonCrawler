- FINALLY! I finally debugged the DialogueManager! It (kinda) works now but the solution is a hacky one. I'll probably fix it later when I need to
- Added some things to the README

Planned for Tomorrow:

- Work on NPC faces
- Work on the DialogueManager
- Make a simple "playable" game where the player can move around the level
- Finish the UI so it renders how I want it to
