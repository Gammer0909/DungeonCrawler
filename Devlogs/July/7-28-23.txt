- I made the UI render in color, then played with it until I liked it.
- Updated readme to seem less daunting
- Added a few more comments to the code

Still got to do these things:
- Work on NPC face renderer
- Work on the DialogueManager
- Make a simple "playable" game where the player can move around the level and talk to NPCs
