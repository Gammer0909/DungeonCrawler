# DungeonCrawler

This is a **heavy** WIP game I'm working on.

It's a Dungeon Crawler (Obviously) like the original *Legend of Zelda*.

However, this one is in the console, with Unicode and ASCII characters instead of sprites.

Follow and star this repo to keep up with the development

# FAQ (I hope)

## How can I follow the development of this game?

As stated above, you can Follow me (Gammer0909), Star and watch this repo, as well as reading my (short) devlogs at [`DungeonCrawler/Devlogs/`](https://github.com/Gammer0909/DungeonCrawler/tree/main/Devlogs) 

## What is this?

This is a game I'm working on modeled after the early Teletype games that were made in the 70s, with a dungeon crawler
aspect of *The Legend of Zelda*.

These are also known as [Text-Based Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)

## Is it runnable?

Right now, the project is **not** runnable. (Note, however, It is "runnable" but there is no playable game yet)

I am working as hard as I can to make it runnable, but it's not runnable yet.

## Can I contribute?

Yes, you can!

Just clone/fork the repo 

    git clone https://github.com/gammer0909/DungeonCrawler.git

make and commit your changes,

and make a pull request!

I will review it, and if it's good, I'll merge it!

## Where are the unit tests?

I honestly have no clue on how to set up a NUnit or xUnit testing project; any help would be appreciated!

## Woah, that code looks useful, can I use your code to make my own Console Game?

Of course! I've been (trying) to designt the game code, managers, renderers, etc. to be useful in any given situation! After I either get the project to a runnable state, or finish the game I plan on releasing the code under the MIT License
for anyone to use to create their Console Game, stay tuned!

Thanks, @Gammer0909
